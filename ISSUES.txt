ISSUE #1

Unable to communicate with proxmox server:

SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=error: certificate verify failed

This error occurs when connecting to a Proxmox server that uses a self-signed certificate.
The latest version of the rest-client now checks for a valid certificate. I tried adding
the Proxmox self-signed CA certificate to my system's trust; however, it does not work
with the rest-client, it does, however, work for browsers. My solution was to use stunnel
to connect estable a local HTTP tunnel to Proxmox, then update my Vagrantfile to connect
to my local HTTP tunnel.
